What is this project:

    This is project is meant to be a recreation of the google homepage as of the time of creating.
    It's the first project given in the Odin Project Curriculum.

Pre Project thoughts:

    This is meant as a first test of my html and css knowledge. I'm extremely new to html and css 
    so this should hopefully be a fun test, and a way for me to get some practical experience.

Post project thoughts:

    Honestly had a ton of fun working on this. Feel like there's a lot I could have done better but
    for a first project I had a blast! In hindsight it probably would have been a better idea to
    use grid for the page layout instead of tediously trying to position everything correctly.
    Definitely something to think about for whatever my next project ends up being at least.
    Also the search bar should've been a form as well but I forgot about
    them whilst working on it. I feel like I'm getting a better handle on remembering what 
    does what in html and css which is nice.
